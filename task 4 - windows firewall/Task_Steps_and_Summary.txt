Steps followed on Windows

1. Opened Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security (wf.msc)
2. Viewed existing Inbound Rules
3. Created new Inbound Rule:
   - Rule Type: Port
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Specific local ports: 23
   - Action: Block the connection
   - Profile: All profiles (Domain, Private, Public)
   - Name: Block Test Port 23
4. Tested with PowerShell:
   Command - "Test-NetConnection 127.0.0.1 -Port 23"
   → TcpTestSucceeded : False (blocked by firewall)
5. Deleted the custom rule “Block Test Port 23”
6. Confirmed rule no longer exists
7. Firewall returned to original state
