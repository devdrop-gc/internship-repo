# Detailed Summary of Findings

## Medium Vulnerabilities (Safe to Ignore on Personal PC)
1. **51192 – SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted**  
   → Local development tools (e.g., Docker Desktop, WSL, localhost web servers) use self-signed certificates.  
   → Only accessible from 127.0.0.1 → No remote risk.

2. **57608 – SMB Signing not required**  
   → Windows allows unsigned SMB on trusted home networks by default.  
   → Signing is enabled when connecting to domain/enterprise environments.  
   → Acceptable risk on a home laptop.

## All Other 30 Findings = Informational Only
Examples:
- OS identification & version disclosure (normal)
- Supported TLS 1.2 / 1.3 (good!)
- Netstat local port listing
- Nessus scan metadata

**Final Verdict**: Personal workstation is fully patched, hardened, and secured.
