## 🔐 Authentication Status
- Authentication: **Failed**
- Reason: No credentials were provided to Nessus (recommended for personal scans using Nessus Essentials).  
- Impact: Scan was performed unauthenticated — equivalent to an external attacker view.  
  This explains the extremely low number of findings and confirms no remotely exploitable vulnerabilities exist.

**Declaration**: Scan performed only on my own personal computer with full authorization. No external systems were scanned.
