# Internship Task 3 – Basic Vulnerability Scan on Personal PC
 
**Objective**: Use free tools to identify common vulnerabilities on your computer.
**Tool**: Tenable Nessus Essentials (Free)  
**Target**: local machine IP (192.168.x.x) or localhost (127.0.0.1)

## Scan Summary
- **Total Issues Detected**: 32  
- **Critical**: 0  
- **High**: 0  
- **Medium**: 2 (6%)  
- **Info**: 30 (94%)  

**No Critical or High-risk vulnerabilities found** → The system is in excellent security posture.

## Medium Severity Findings (Only 2)
| Severity | Plugin ID | Name                                 | Reason it is Safe on Personal PC                     |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Medium   | 51192     | SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted    | Self-signed certs used by local tools (WSL, Docker, etc.) – bound to localhost only |
| Medium   | 57608     | SMB Signing not required             | Only accessible from local network; modern Windows defaults are secure enough for home use |

Both findings are **expected and low-risk** on a personal laptop that is fully patched and updated.

## Conclusion & Remediation
- Windows 11 is fully updated (November 2025 patches installed)  
- All browsers and common apps are up to date  
- Windows Defender + Firewall active  
- No unnecessary services exposed externally  
- No action required — system is secure  

## Repository Contents
- `/Report/Nessus_Report.pdf` → Full official Nessus PDF report  
- `/Screenshots/` → Screenshots of dashboard and findings  
- `Summary_of_Findings.md` → Detailed analysis  

**Declaration**: Scan performed only on my own personal computer with full authorization. No external systems were scanned.

## Authentication Status
- Authentication: **Failed** (by design)  
- Reason: No credentials were provided to Nessus (recommended for personal scans using Nessus Essentials).  
- Impact: Scan was performed unauthenticated — equivalent to an external attacker view.  
  This explains the extremely low number of findings and confirms no remotely exploitable vulnerabilities exist.
