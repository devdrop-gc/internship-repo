# 🔍 Local Network Open Ports Scan  

## 🎯 Objective
Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand network exposure.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Nmap**  
- **Wireshark** 

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Installed Nmap**   
2. **Local IP range** – `192.168.1.0/24` (found via `ipconfig`)  
3. **Scan command** – `nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24`  
4. **Results** – see `scan_results.txt`  
5. **Packet capture** – started Wireshark on interface `Wi-Fi`, saved as `wireshark_capture.png`  
6. **Services research** – documented in `services_research.md`  
7. **Security risks** – documented in `security_risks.md`
